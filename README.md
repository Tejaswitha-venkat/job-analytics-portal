## Architecture Overview
### Frontend
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript : Core frontend technologies
- Plotly.js : For creating interactive charts and dashboards
- Bootstrap : For responsive design and UI components
- Netlify : For hosting and continuous deployment
### Backend (Optional)
- Node.js with Express : Lightweight API server to handle data processing
- Alternative : Flask (Python) if you prefer Python-based backend
### Data Pipeline
- ETL Process : Python scripts using libraries like Pandas for data transformation
- Data Sources : Integration with job APIs (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.) or web scraping
- Scheduled Jobs : Using cron jobs or Airflow for regular data updates
**###Data Visualization Enhancement for Job Titles and Companies**
  These visualizations already provide good insights into job titles and companies:

- The Companies Chart clearly shows which companies are hiring the most, giving users immediate insight into the top employers in the job market.
- The Job Listings Table displays job titles prominently, allowing users to quickly scan available positions.
- The new Company Filter I added in the previous update allows users to filter jobs by specific companies, making it easier to focus on employers of interest.
- ## What Happens When You Run the Application
When you start the server:

1. 
   The Express server will start on port 8080 (or the port specified in your environment variables)
2. 
   The application will perform an initial data fetch using the fetchAndProcessJobData() function
3. 3.
   Sample job data will be generated and saved to public/data/jobs_data.json
4. 
   The server will set up scheduled tasks using node-cron to update job data hourly
5. 
   The web interface will be available at http://localhost:8080
